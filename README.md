### __Usage__ 💻
<br>

* To use this application the user will need to open the application and click on the "Get Started" button. 
* The user will then be taken to a new webpage that will allow the user to input information.
* The user has the ability to enter in a "Title" for their specific note and then after a title is entered in, the user can then add notes to remind them of whatever it is they need to be reminded of.
* Once both inputs have been filled there will be an option to save the notes in the form of a floppy disk icon near the top right corner. 
* Once the user saves their note, it will be displayed on the left hand side with the title as the only thing showing up until they click on it.
